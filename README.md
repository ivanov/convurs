This is a demonstration of backend code for the GirlsWhoCode camp.

It implements a chatting website, starting simple and getting a bit more complicated in steps.

1) hello.py - A function which prints "hello"
2) hello_flask.py - A flask view which returns "hello"
3) hello_echo.py - A view which just echos back the url argument
4) convurs_logo.py - An html page showing an image logo.
5) convurs.py - A simple chatting backend.
6) convurs_names.py - Chatting with usernames.
7) convurs_storage.py - Chatting with saving messages to a file.
